
I picked Java language because it is the most familiar language to me and it is a cross platform language.
also I used JSP to view the data because it helps me to view a dynamic data.

What I learned in the process:

- Using Heroku and Travis for the first time was very useful and an amazing tools to be known for me.
- I got some hands-on experience in general.

My thought process :

- check the JSON API and understand its parameters
- select The technologies to be used like Servlets/jsps and so on.
- think about the way to present and collects the data
- What data to be shown for each offer
